# Forewarned is Forearmed - Extreme Events Tool

When competing risk assessments for northern beef and sugar, assessing the likelihood of extreme events occurring in 
the future is difficult. For nearly all of the thresholds used, there has been no analysis of the historical records in 
order to assess their climatological occurrence, so the likelihood of these events occurring was impossible to quantify 
accurately within a reasonable timeframe.

To assist with this kind of analysis, the development of a simple tool was requested. It would need capacity to handle 
multiple variables, different thresholds and different accumulation periods for stations throughout Australia.

An extreme weather event is not always characterised by one climate variable, such as temperature. In many cases, 
weather that is cold, wet and windy has a far greater impact than cold alone. Additionally, thresholds for what 
constitutes an extreme weather event can differ by location (for example, 38 °C for 3 days at Longreach will provide 
little heat stress risk, but may be more concerning at Charters Towers). Having one-fit-for-all thresholds do not 
suffice.

This tool is designed to review historical records and report instances of extreme weather events, where the threshold 
of what constitutes an extreme event can be customised by the user. Options include:

* Station (location)
* Temperature
* Precipitation
* Windspeed
* Number of consecutive days

Climate variables can be combined as necessary to investigate extreme events caused by more than one factor (for 
example, temperature below 5°C combined with windspeed above 5m/s).
